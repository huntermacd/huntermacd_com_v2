          My name is Hunter MacDermut and I'm a front-end web developer
          currently living Boulder, CO. I'm a mostly self-taught programmer,
          having picked up much of what I know doing contract work for the past
          two and a half years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to getting into web development, I taught
          guitar lessons for seven and a half years. I enjoy learning new things
          and find that teaching is the best way to do that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Outside of doing computer work, I enjoy skateboarding, practicing the
          guitar, and playing board and video games.
