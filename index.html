          My name is Hunter MacDermut and I'm a front-end web developer
          currently living in Boulder, CO. I'm a self-taught programmer,
          having picked up much of what I know doing contract work with
          <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/">Caktus Group</a> and
          <a href="http://www.coxmediagroup.com/">Cox Media Group</a>
          since May 2014. I keep on top of new tools and frameworks by regularly
          taking courses on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/huntermacdermut">
          Treehouse</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/353167">
          Code School</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Prior to getting into web development, I taught
          guitar lessons for seven and a half years. I enjoy learning new things
          and find that teaching is the best way to do that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of doing computer work, I enjoy skateboarding, practicing the
          guitar, and playing board and video games.
